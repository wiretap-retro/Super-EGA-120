## Info
A while back I bought a scrap lot containing a small PCB with a crystal oscillator attached to an EGA video card. I did a little research to figure out what it was, and came across the September 16, 1986 issue of PC Magazine describing how to build the same type PCB. It enables older EGA video cards to use 120 column mode.

Included in this repository are the PCB gerber files, BOM, PC Magazine snippet of the project, and the corresponding PC Magazine software examples.
